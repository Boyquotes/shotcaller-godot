## RTS Engine

As laid out in [Everlasting Games](https://spicylobster.itch.io/jumpy/devlog/337996/everlasting-games), part of Spicy Lobster's long term ambition is to build moddable game engines for specific game archetypes. One such archetype engine was Warcraft 3, a top-down RTS/RPG engine capable of making anything from a tower defense to a MOBA or even an online RPG.

Tiny bit by bit, we are re-making this type of top-down strategy-adventure engine (on top of Godot), beginning in 2D pixels just like Warcraft 2 and [many of its precedessors](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/build-gather-brawl-repeat-the-history-of-real-time-strategy-games/).

Shotcaller is our primary (but not only) means of shaping this engine because we follow the principle of '[Write Games, Not Engines](https://geometrian.com/programming/tutorials/write-games-not-engines/)'. Other collaborators are helping us shape this engine with their own respective games (mods/expansions), inspired by the likes of [Dark Deeds](https://darkdeeds.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Deeds_Wiki), [Founding of Durotar](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Founding_of_Durotar), and even [Warlords Battlecry](https://etheria.fandom.com/wiki/Warlords_Battlecry_III).

The shared engine-layer for all these games will be licensed as MIT or similar.

This prototype was made with Godot Engine.

Previous iteration: [Shotcaller made in minigene](https://github.com/spicylobstergames/shotcaller-minigene), a Rust-lang terminal-first engine.
